permalink: /co542/e20/Panic-Attack-Prediction/
description: Mental health disorders, including panic attacks, are rising globally.
  Traditional diagnosis relies on self-reports, which can be subjective. Using machine
  learning and neural networks, our project analyzes physiological and lifestyle data
  to predict panic attacks, enabling proactive management and intervention to improve
  mental well-being.
