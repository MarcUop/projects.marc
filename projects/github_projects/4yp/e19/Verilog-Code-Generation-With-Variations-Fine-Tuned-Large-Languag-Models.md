title: Verilog Code Generation With Variations Fine Tuned Large Languag Models
permalink: /4yp/e19/Verilog-Code-Generation-With-Variations-Fine-Tuned-Large-Languag-Models/
description: This research focuses on automating the generation of Verilog code (a
  hardware description language) using Large Language Models (LLMs). The motivation
  behind this project is to simplify and accelerate hardware design processes by leveraging
  AI-based tools.
