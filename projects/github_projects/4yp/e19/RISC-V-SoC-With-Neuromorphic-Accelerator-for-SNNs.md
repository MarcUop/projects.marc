title: RISC V SoC With Neuromorphic Accelerator for SNNs
permalink: /4yp/e19/RISC-V-SoC-With-Neuromorphic-Accelerator-for-SNNs/
description: This project develops a RISC-V SoC with an integrated Neuromorphic Accelerator
  for small-scale Spiking Neural Network (SNN) applications. The SoC is designed for
  low-power, low-latency edge computing, enabling efficient neuromorphic processing
  for embedded systems and real-time AI workloads.
